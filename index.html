    <br />
    <p>Advanced array methods allow you to apply logic to every element within an array. These methods are used extensively in JavaScript and React!</p>
    <br />
    <p>The Filter method is used to create a new array that only contains elements from the original array which pass a test.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The Map method is used to create a new array that contains the result of calling a function on each item in the original array.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The Reduce method is used to 'reduce' an array of elements into a single value.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Use the debugger and console.logs to test your results as you work through these problems!</p>
